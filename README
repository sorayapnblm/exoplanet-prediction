# Predicting Exoplanet Count Using Stellar Features: A Data-Driven Approach with Linear Regression

This project explores the relationship between stars and their exoplanet companions by predicting the number of exoplanets based on stellar characteristics. 
The model was optimized to enhance computational efficiency, achieving a 79% reduction in execution time. Additionally, I incorporated data visualizations to illustrate key patterns and insights, combining my technical expertise in computer science with my passion for astronomy.
